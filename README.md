# Ubuntu Help Desk Lab
This repository documents the creation of a fully simulated Tier 1 Help Dsk envrionment using Ubuntu Desktop inside a VirtualBox Vm.  Each step is broken down with beginner friendly, click-by-click instructions to make it accessible to anyone, even with no IT background.  This project is part of my mission to master IT Help Desk Fundamentals as a stepping stone toward becoming a Network Security Expert.
